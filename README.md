# KURPOD

**Hide your private documents, photos, files inside "vacation.jpg"**

Encrypted file containers with innocent filenames. Your 1,000 personal files become one disguised blob - portable, secure, and tiny.

A self-hosted a single ~2MB binary.
No accounts. No tracking. No cloud dependencies.

## What This Actually Does

**KURPOD creates encrypted blob files that you can name anything.** 

- Name it `vacation.jpg` - looks like a photo to casual observers
- Name it `work_report.pdf` - appears to be a document  
- Name it `music_playlist.m3u` - seems like a music file

**Important**: This is filename disguise, not true file format mimicry. Technical inspection (`file` command) will show it's encrypted data. But for everyday privacy i.e shared computers, cloud storage, basic inspection the innocent filename provides excellent camouflage. True steganography is planned in the future. 

The real magic is the **dual-volume encryption** that lets you hide a second encrypted space inside the same file.

## The Hidden Compartment Trick

Every KURPOD container has **two encrypted volumes**:
- **Password #1**: Opens decoy files (fake spreadsheets, boring documents)  
- **Password #2**: Opens your real files (private photos, crypto wallets, sensitive docs)

Someone forces you to unlock it? Give them Password #1. They see innocent files. Your real data stays completely hidden in a second encrypted volume.

```
my_vacation.jpg  (2.3MB encrypted container)
â”œâ”€â”€ Password "summer2023" â†’ Decoy: 25 vacation photos
â””â”€â”€ Password "dolphins847" â†’ Hidden: crypto keys, private documents, job applications
```

**What they see**: Vacation photos in a JPEG file  
**What you know**: Dual-encrypted vault with everything that matters


## How it works

1. Run kurpod server (single binary, Docker, hombrew or build from source)
2. Create encrypted blob with password
3. Access through web interface
4. Upload files - they get encrypted and stored
5. Optional: create second encrypted volume with different password

---

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Homebrew (macOS - Recommended)
```bash
# Add tap and install
brew tap srv1n/kurpod https://github.com/srv1n/kurpod.git
brew install kurpod

# Start server (defaults to port 3000 and ./blobs directory)
kurpod_server

# Access at http://localhost:3000
# â†’ Need a different port or storage location? See the
#   "ðŸ”§ Configuration & Usage" section below for all flags.
```

**Troubleshooting Homebrew Cache Issues:**
```bash
# If you get "already installed" with old version or SHA256 mismatch:
brew update                    # Refresh formula from tap
brew reinstall kurpod         # Force reinstall latest version

# If that doesn't work, clear cache:
brew cleanup -s               # Clear all caches
brew uninstall kurpod        # Remove old version
brew install kurpod          # Fresh install
```

**Uninstall:**
```bash
# Remove KURPOD
brew uninstall kurpod

# Remove tap (optional - removes the formula repository)
brew untap srv1n/kurpod

# Clean up any remaining dependencies
brew autoremove
```

### Option 2: Docker (Cross-platform)
```bash
# Run latest version
docker run -p 3000:3000 -v ./data:/app/data ghcr.io/srv1n/kurpod:latest

# Open browser to http://localhost:3000
```

**Cleanup:**
```bash
# Stop and remove running container
docker stop $(docker ps -q --filter ancestor=ghcr.io/srv1n/kurpod)
docker rm $(docker ps -aq --filter ancestor=ghcr.io/srv1n/kurpod)

# Remove downloaded image
docker rmi ghcr.io/srv1n/kurpod:latest

# Remove all unused images, containers, and volumes (optional)
docker system prune -a --volumes
```

### Option 3: Auto-Install Script
```bash
# Auto-install for Linux/macOS
curl -L https://github.com/srv1n/kurpod/releases/latest/download/install.sh | bash

# Then run
kurpod_server
```

**Uninstall:**
```bash
# Remove from user installation directory
rm -f ~/.local/bin/kurpod_server

# Or remove from system-wide installation
sudo rm -f /usr/local/bin/kurpod_server

# Clean up PATH entries in shell profile (if added manually)
# Edit ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc and remove the ~/.local/bin PATH export line
```

### Option 4: Manual Download
Download the appropriate binary for your platform from the [releases page](https://github.com/srv1n/kurpod/releases).

**Cleanup:**
```bash
# Remove the binary from wherever you placed it
rm -f /path/to/kurpod_server

# If you moved it to a system directory
sudo rm -f /usr/local/bin/kurpod_server

# Remove any data files created (optional - this deletes your encrypted blobs!)
# rm -rf ./blobs/
# rm -f ./storage.blob
```

---

## How It Works

### Simple Setup
1. **Deploy KURPOD** - Single binary, Docker, or Homebrew installation
2. **Initialize storage** - Create encrypted blob with password(s)
3. **Access securely** - Web interface with session-based authentication
4. **Upload & manage** - Drag-and-drop files with real-time encryption

### Advanced Security Model

#### Session-Based Authentication
- **Split-key architecture** - Cryptographic keys divided between client and server
- **Bearer token auth** - HMAC-SHA256 signed tokens with IP/UA binding
- **Automatic timeouts** - 15-minute idle, 2-hour absolute session limits
- **Memory security** - All cryptographic material zeroized on cleanup

#### Encryption Implementation
- **Algorithm**: XChaCha20-Poly1305 AEAD with 256-bit keys
- **Key derivation**: Argon2id (64MB memory, 3 iterations, unique salt)
- **Nonce generation**: 192-bit cryptographically secure random per chunk
- **Chunk size**: 64KB blocks for optimal streaming performance
- **Metadata protection**: File names, sizes, and directory structure encrypted

#### Dual-Volume Architecture
**Standard Volume**: Normal encrypted storage accessed with primary password
**Hidden Volume**: Secondary encrypted space accessed with different password
- Mathematically indistinguishable from random data
- No headers, signatures, or detectible patterns
- Provides cryptographic deniability under coercion
- Independent encryption keys and data structures

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can the UI prove I didn't create a hidden volume?**  
A: No. The whole point is that the blob is indistinguishable from random data, so the server/frontend cannot reveal that fact either way.

**Q: What happens when I delete files?**  
A: Deleting a file removes its metadata immediately. The encrypted data remains until you run compaction to reclaim space.

**Q: Is this ready for production use?**  
A: This is an initial release that works well for personal use and testing. The core cryptography uses established algorithms (XChaCha20-Poly1305, Argon2id), but we recommend thorough testing before critical use. Community feedback is welcome.

**Q: How do I verify downloads?**  
A: All releases include SHA256 checksums and GPG signatures. Download `SHA256SUMS` and verify with `sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS`.

**Q: What's the difference between GNU and musl builds?**  
A: GNU libc is standard on most Linux distributions. musl is smaller and works on Alpine Linux and static deployments.

**Q: Can I run this on a Raspberry Pi?**  
A: Yes! Use the ARM64 builds on 64-bit Raspberry Pi OS (Raspberry Pi 3B+ or newer).

**Q: How does session management work?**  
A: Sessions timeout after 15 minutes of inactivity or 2 hours maximum. All cryptographic material is automatically cleaned from memory.

**Q: Can I use this with cloud storage?**  
A: Yes! The blob file can be stored on cloud services (Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.) for backup, but KURPOD itself handles the encryption.
