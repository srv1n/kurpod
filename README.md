# KURPOD

**Self-hosted encrypted file storage system** with XChaCha20-Poly1305 encryption, plausible deniability, and a modern web interface.

Your own encrypted file vault - self-hosted and delivered in a single ~2MB binary.
No accounts. No tracking. No cloud dependencies.

---
## ELI5 

Think of a Kurpod file as a **portable, encrypted hard drive packed into a single file**. It's like a super secure ZIP archive or a virtual disk that you can disguise as anything you want.

Hereâ€™s how it works:

1.  **Create Your Secure Containers:** You can create as many separate Kurpod files as you need one for work projects, one for personal photos, another for tax documents. Each file acts as its own independent, secure container. When you want to access one, you open it with your password to manage its contents, just like mounting a private file system.

2.  **Fill Them Up:** Pack each container with as many private files as you need: documents, photos, videos, and even entire folders. They are all stored neatly inside that one file.

3.  **Disguise Them:** This is where the magic happens. You can name each container file anything you want, like `vacation_photos.jpg` or `project_report.pdf`. To your operating system and anyone else, they look and behave just like normal, innocent files.

4.  **Keep Them Private & Portable:** Everything inside is powerfully encrypted. The only way to see the contents is with your password. Since each container is just a single file, you can easily copy them to a USB drive, back them up, or share them with others.

### **The Hidden Compartment: Ultimate Plausible Deniability**

This is Kurpod's most powerful feature. Every Kurpod file you create actually contains a secret, secondary storage space inside it.

You set **two different passwords** for the same file:

*   **Password #1 (The Decoy):** Unlocks a "public-facing" space. You can fill this with plausible, everyday files that you wouldn't mind showing someone.
*   **Password #2 (The Real Deal):** Unlocks the hidden compartment containing your most sensitive data.

If you are ever forced to reveal a password, you can give up the decoy one. The other person will see a perfectly normal set of files and will have no way of knowing that a second, completely separate set of data is secretly hidden within the very same file, appearing as nothing more than random, unreadable data.


## How it works

1. Run kurpod server (single binary, Docker, hombrew or build from source)
2. Create encrypted blob with password
3. Access through web interface
4. Upload files - they get encrypted and stored
5. Optional: create second encrypted volume with different password

### Option 1: Homebrew (macOS - Recommended)
```bash
# Add tap and install
brew tap srv1n/kurpod https://github.com/srv1n/kurpod.git
brew install kurpod

# Start server
kurpod_server

# Access at http://localhost:3000
```

**Uninstall:**
```bash
# Remove KURPOD
brew uninstall kurpod

brew autoremove
```

### Option 2: Docker (Cross-platform)
```bash
# Run latest version
docker run -p 3000:3000 -v ./data:/app/data ghcr.io/srv1n/kurpod:latest

# Open browser to http://localhost:3000
```

**Cleanup:**
```bash
# Stop and remove running container
docker stop $(docker ps -q --filter ancestor=ghcr.io/srv1n/kurpod)
docker rm $(docker ps -aq --filter ancestor=ghcr.io/srv1n/kurpod)

docker rmi ghcr.io/srv1n/kurpod:latest

# Remove all unused images, containers, and volumes (optional)
docker system prune -a --volumes
```

### Option 3: Auto-Install Script
```bash
# Auto-install for Linux/macOS
curl -L https://github.com/srv1n/kurpod/releases/latest/download/install.sh | bash

# Then run
kurpod_server
```

**Uninstall:**
```bash
# Remove from user installation directory
rm -f ~/.local/bin/kurpod_server

# Or remove from system-wide installation
sudo rm -f /usr/local/bin/kurpod_server

# Clean up PATH entries in shell profile (if added manually)
# Edit ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc and remove the ~/.local/bin PATH export line
```

### Option 4: Manual Download
Download the appropriate binary for your platform from the [releases page](https://github.com/srv1n/kurpod/releases).

**Cleanup:**
```bash
# Remove the binary from wherever you placed it
rm -f /path/to/kurpod_server

# If you moved it to a system directory
sudo rm -f /usr/local/bin/kurpod_server

# Remove any data files created (optional - this deletes your encrypted blobs!)
# rm -rf ./blobs/

- **Use HTTPS**: Deploy behind a reverse proxy (nginx, Caddy, Traefik) with SSL/TLS
- **Firewall**: Restrict access to trusted networks
- **VPN**: Consider VPN access for remote usage

#### Storage Security
- **Backup**: Regularly backup your blob files
- **Storage**: Use encrypted storage (LUKS, FileVault, BitLocker) for additional protection
- **Permissions**: Restrict file permissions on blob files (`chmod 600`)

#### Operational Security
- **Passwords**: Use strong, unique passwords for both standard and hidden volumes
- **Sessions**: Log out when finished (automatic timeout after 15 minutes)
- **Updates**: Keep KURPOD updated to the latest version

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can the UI prove I didn't create a hidden volume?**  
A: No. The whole point is that the blob is indistinguishable from random data, so the server/frontend cannot reveal that fact either way.

**Q: What happens when I delete files?**  
A: Deleting a file removes its metadata immediately. The encrypted data remains until you run compaction to reclaim space.

**Q: Is this ready for production use?**  
A: This is an initial release that works well for personal use and testing. The core cryptography uses established algorithms (XChaCha20-Poly1305, Argon2id), but we recommend thorough testing before critical use. Community feedback is welcome.

**Q: How do I verify downloads?**  
A: All releases include SHA256 checksums and GPG signatures. Download `SHA256SUMS` and verify with `sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS`.

**Q: What's the difference between GNU and musl builds?**  
A: GNU libc is standard on most Linux distributions. musl is smaller and works on Alpine Linux and static deployments.

**Q: Can I run this on a Raspberry Pi?**  
A: Yes! Use the ARM64 builds on 64-bit Raspberry Pi OS (Raspberry Pi 3B+ or newer).

**Q: How does session management work?**  
A: Sessions timeout after 15 minutes of inactivity or 2 hours maximum. All cryptographic material is automatically cleaned from memory.

**Q: Can I use this with cloud storage?**  
A: Yes! The blob file can be stored on cloud services (Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.) for backup, but KURPOD itself handles the encryption.
