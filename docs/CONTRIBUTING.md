- Use GitHub Issues to report bugs
- Include detailed reproduction steps
- Provide system information and logs
- Check if the issue already exists

#### üí° Feature Requests
- Describe the problem you're trying to solve
- Explain why this feature would be useful
- Consider if it fits the project's scope
- Be open to alternative solutions

#### üîß Code Contributions
- Bug fixes
- Performance improvements
- Security enhancements
- Documentation improvements
- Test coverage increases

#### üìö Documentation
- README improvements
- Code comments
- User guides
- API documentation

### Before You Start

1. **Check existing issues** to avoid duplicate work
2. **Open an issue** to discuss large changes
3. **Review the architecture** in [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)
4. **Understand the security model** before making changes

## Development Workflow

### 1. Fork and Clone

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub, then:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/kurpod.git
cd kurpod
git remote add upstream https://github.com/srv1n/kurpod.git
```

### 2. Create a Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
```

### 3. Make Your Changes

#### Code Style

**Rust Code:**
- Follow standard Rust formatting: `cargo fmt`
- Pass all lints: `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`
- Add tests for new functionality
- Document public APIs

**Frontend Code:**
- Follow ESLint rules: `bun lint`
- Use TypeScript for new code when possible
- Follow React best practices
- Test UI changes in multiple browsers

#### Commit Messages

Use conventional commit format:

```
feat: add batch file upload support
fix: resolve memory leak in file processing
docs: update installation instructions
test: add unit tests for encryption core
refactor: simplify file upload handling
```

Types:
- `feat`: New features
- `fix`: Bug fixes
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `refactor`: Code changes that don't fix bugs or add features
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

### 4. Test Your Changes

```bash
# Run Rust tests
cargo test

# Run frontend linting
cd frontend && bun lint

# Build everything
./build.sh

# Test manual workflow
./run.sh
# Test in browser: http://localhost:3000
```

### 5. Security Testing

For security-related changes:

- Test with various password strengths
- Verify encryption/decryption works correctly
- Check for timing attacks in password comparison
- Ensure memory is properly cleared
- Test error conditions

### 6. Submit Pull Request

```bash
git push origin your-branch-name
```

Then create a Pull Request on GitHub with:

- **Clear title** describing the change
- **Detailed description** of what and why
- **Testing notes** for reviewers
- **Screenshots** for UI changes
- **Breaking changes** clearly marked

## Pull Request Requirements

### All Pull Requests Must:

1. **Pass CI checks**:
   - All tests must pass
   - Code must build successfully
   - Linting must pass

2. **Include tests**:
   - Unit tests for new functions
   - Integration tests for new features
   - Manual testing notes

3. **Update documentation**:
   - Update README if needed
   - Add/update code comments
   - Update user manual for UI changes

4. **Follow security practices**:
   - No hardcoded secrets or passwords
   - Proper input validation
   - Memory safety considerations
   - Error handling without information leakage

### Review Process

1. **Automated checks** run on every PR
2. **Security review** for crypto/auth changes
3. **Code review** by maintainers
4. **Testing** on multiple platforms
5. **Documentation review** for clarity

## Special Considerations

### Security-Critical Changes

Changes to encryption, authentication, or security features require:

- Extra scrutiny and testing
- Security-focused code review
- Discussion of threat model impact
- Possible security audit

### Performance Changes

For performance-related changes:

- Include benchmarks showing improvement
- Test with large files and datasets
- Verify memory usage doesn't increase significantly
- Test on different hardware configurations

### Breaking Changes

Breaking changes require:

- Clear justification for the breaking change
- Migration guide for users
- Version bump discussion
- Extra communication to users
